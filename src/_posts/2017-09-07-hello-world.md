## Ready

Installing <i>ruby</i> and <i>jekyll</i> on my laptop, based on [jekyll installation reference](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/).

## Set

- ``jekyll new (project)``
- understand how _jekyll_ works; see [jekyll-docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home), especially [file structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) and [common variables](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/)
- find a suitable _jekyll_ project; in my case, I picked [clean blog](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll.git)

## Go

- customize _config.yml_, _head.html_ _nav.html_, _footer.html_
- worked on _about.html_
- explorer using other technologies _Github Pages_. Tried on [using Angular on my resume page]({{site.url}}/resume)

## Further and Deeper...

- use _yaml_ files in _\_data_ directory to automate and simplify the code (based on instructions [in this page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/)).
- there are *so many* features beyond the basic syntax. I am using separate blog(s?) for the advanced features I encountered (see [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-10-extended-jekyll-study %}))
